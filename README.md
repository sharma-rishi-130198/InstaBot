# InstaBot

## Overview

In this project, I developed an Instagram Automation Bot to perform various automated tasks on Instagram, demonstrating my proficiency in web automation, scripting, and Python programming. The bot interacts with Instagramâ€™s web interface using browser automation tools, performing tasks such as searching for profiles, liking/unliking posts, following/unfollowing users, and extracting follower data.

## Features

### 1. **Search Automation**
- Logs into an Instagram account with provided credentials of a dummy account.
- Searches for the keyword "food" and retrieves a list of Instagram handles without printing hashtags.

### 2. **Profile Navigation**
- Opens specific Instagram profiles (e.g., "So Delhi") for further actions.

### 3. **Follow/Unfollow Automation**
- Follows a specific handle and prints a message if already following.
- Unfollows the handle and prints a message if already unfollowed.

### 4. **Post Interaction**
- Automates liking and unliking of the top 30 posts of a specified handle (e.g., "dilsefoodie"), ensuring no duplicate actions.

### 5. **Follower Data Extraction**
- Extracts usernames of the first 500 followers for specified handles (e.g., "foodtalkindia" and "sodelhi").
- Identifies mutual followers by cross-referencing the follower list.

### 6. **Story Interaction**
- Automates story checks for a handle and provides feedback for different scenarios:
  - If the story is already viewed.
  - If the user has no story.
  - If the story is available but not yet seen.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for implementing the bot.
- **Selenium**: For browser automation and interacting with Instagram's web interface.
- **Pandas**: For efficient data handling and analysis of follower data.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing trends or statistics related to followers or posts.
- **Chrome WebDriver**: To control and automate browser interactions.

## Key Learnings
- Gained hands-on experience with web automation and browser control using Selenium.
- Implemented robust error handling for scenarios like already-followed accounts or non-existent stories.
- Enhanced skills in data extraction, validation, and processing by efficiently handling large follower datasets for analysis and comparison.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Update the script with your Instagram credentials.
4. Run the script using a Python IDE or terminal.

## Future Enhancements

- Add functionality to download posts or stories.
- Implement a GUI for easier interaction with the bot.
- Expand bot capabilities to include direct messaging.

## Applications
This project is relevant for use cases like:

- Automating redundant/daily tasks for social media account management.
- Extracting insights from Instagram profiles for analytics.
- Demonstrating automation skills for software engineering roles.
